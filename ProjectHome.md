Multi-agent systems are a particularly interesting alternative to be applied in
distributed systems, in which the different elements act autonomously and they must
communicate and coordinate in order to achieve a common task. One of these scenarios
is the efficient cleaning of a city.
In this problem, there are various types of agents available in the system,
endowed with different sensing, acting and communicating abilities, that must
cooperate and coordinate in order to recycle as much garbage as possible in a given
amount of time. The proposed solution must take into account the characteristics of the
map, the different types of garbage and the number of points given when this garbage is
recycled.
